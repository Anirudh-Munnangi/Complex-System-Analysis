Complex-System-Analysis
=======================

Very basic complex system example. Contains activities performed on a cellular automaton.

When we are dealing with real life applications, we often have to design tools which are in accordance to the needs of
implementation in real life and this calls for one very important aspect i.e. Cost.
We want to design big things which can be built in a low price without compromise to the performance.

Now, far away from this idea, complex system researcher continuously work with very high cost and complex models or structures of algorithms and are trying to bring down their implementation cost to acceptable levels. This repository shows some of that kind of algorithms.
